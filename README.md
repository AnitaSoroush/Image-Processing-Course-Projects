#Summary:
This project focuses on image processing techniques, specifically face detection, and transformation using OpenCV and clustering-based image compression with K-means. It involves grayscale conversion, face cropping, affine and perspective transformations, and image compression through color quantization.

#Keywords: Face Detection, Image Transformation, Grayscale Conversion, K-Means Clustering, Image Compression
