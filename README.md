This project focuses on image processing techniques, specifically face detection, and transformation using OpenCV and clustering-based image compression with K-means. It involves grayscale conversion, face cropping, affine and perspective transformations, and image compression through color quantization.
### Keywords: **Face Detection, Image Transformation, Grayscale Conversion, K-Means Clustering, Image Compression**

This project explores image processing techniques, including cartoonization, image compression, and noise filtering. It leverages OpenCV and NumPy for grayscale conversion, adaptive thresholding, K-means clustering, Gaussian noise addition, and denoising.
### Keywords: **Cartoonization, Image Compression, K-Means Clustering, Gaussian Noise, Denoising**

This project consists of two exercises. The first exercise creates a hybrid image by applying the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to two input images, extracting high and low-frequency components, and then combining them. The second exercise classifies grayscale fingerprint images without machine learning by preprocessing images, extracting gradient directions, and comparing them to reference samples.
### Keywords: **Hybrid Image, Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), High-Pass & Low-Pass Filtering, Image Classification, Gradient Direction Analysis, Morphological Processing**

This project explores image processing techniques, focusing on boundary extraction, hole filling, and texture synthesis. It employs morphological operations, Laplacian of Gaussian (LoG), and inpainting for image enhancement and manipulation.
### Keywords: **Boundary Extraction, Morphological Gradient, Laplacian of Gaussian (LoG), Hole Filling, Texture Synthesis, Patch-Based Image Quilting**
> - # [Project5](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1IKUpb1Fo0769nr1VR0eEaKxgiKa7wcfT?usp=sharing):
This project implements the JPEG compression algorithm, including image blocking, Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT), quantization, zigzag scanning, and encoding/decoding processes to compress and reconstruct images efficiently.
